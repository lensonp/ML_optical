A wide-range spectrum, spanning the UV, VUV and soft X-ray regions, from 5 to 200 eV has also been obtained at low resolution (∼1 eV fwhm), and this has been used to determine the absolute oscillator strength scale by employing valence shell TRK [i.e., S(0)] sum-rule normalization.

Evaluation of the S(−2) sum using the presently reported absolute differential photoabsorption oscillator strength data gives a static dipole polarizability for benzene in good agreement (within ∼3.4\%) with published polarizability values obtained from optical measurements.

	abstract = {Absorption spectra of HCOOH were measured between 6 and 22 eV at a maximum resolution of 3 meV. Previous measurements had a spectral limit of 11.7 eV. Analysis and band assignment were aided by data from theoretical calculations on valence and Rydberg states and from photoelectron spectroscopy. Five valence transitions and the different types of Rydberg transitions converging to the ground and the first excited electronic state of HCOOH+ are discussed and assigned in the spectral region below 12.3 eV. Our assignments differ considerably in many aspects from those of previous studies. Observation, analysis and assignment of absorption features between 12 and 22 eV were carried out for the first time. Rydberg bands converging to five expected ionization limits were not observed as discrete features, except for the 32A′ ion state, corresponding to promotion of an 8a′ electron. The Rydberg bands converging to the other ionization limits are broad and merge to form broad absorption features. Assignments are made for npa′←8a′ and nda′←8a′ Rydberg transitions, which exhibit discrete absorption bands. It is shown that Rydberg states in the 15.7–16.8 eV region undergo autoionization with a rate kai≈7.5×1013 s−1 and that this autoionization is probably dissociative.},

Significant temperature effects are observed in several spectral regions, including the threshold absorption region. From the Pc,370K curve we are able to identify and assign several hot bands. When the gas temperature decreases from 370 K to 140 K, the cross sections of the hot bands in the 190 nm region decrease by an order of magnitude. The line shapes of the Pc,T exhibit characteristic symmetric and asymmetric peaks, as well as the first derivative-like and second derivative-like curves associated with various absorption features. The results obtained in the present work provide the required data to the planetary atmospheres community and may have an important contribution to our understanding of the atmospheres of giant planets.},

Absolute oscillator strengths (transition probabilities) for discrete and continuum photoabsorption transitions have been determined throughout the entire energy range. The lower energy regions (7–50 eV) of the spectra have also been studied at high resolution (0.048 eV fwhm), and essentially all the features observed in the discrete excitation region of CH4, C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10 can be reasonably assigned to Rydberg transitions by using quantum defects and the transferability of term values. The quite good agreement between the present results and the constrained dipole oscillator strength distribution (DOSD) values computed by Jhanwar, Meath, and MacDonald [Can. J. Phys. 59 (1981) 185] shows that the techniques utilized in constructing the DOSDs provide a reasonably satisfactory estimate of the absolute photoabsorption oscillator strengths for the linear alkanes.},

	abstract = {Absorption cross sections of 24 volatile and non-volatile derivatives of benzene in the ultraviolet (UV) and the infrared (IR) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum have been determined using a 1080 l quartz cell. For the UV a 0.5 m Czerny-Turner spectrometer coupled with a photodiode array detector (spectral resolution 0.15 nm) was used. IR spectra were recorded with an FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker IFS-88, spectral resolution 1 cm-1). Absolute absorption cross sections and the instrument function are given for the UV, while for the IR, absorption cross sections and integrated band intensities are reported.

The study focused primarily on the atmospherically relevant methylated benzenes (benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, ethylbenzene, styrene) and their ring retaining oxidation products (benzaldehyde, o-tolualdehyde, m-tolualdehyde, p-tolualdehyde, phenol, o-cresol, m-cresol, p-cresol, 2,3-dimethylphenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 2,5-dimethylphenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 3,4-dimethylphenol, 3,5-dimethylphenol, 2,4,6-trimethylphenol and (E,Z)- and (E,E)-2,4-hexadienedial).

The UV absorption cross sections reported here can be used for the evaluation of DOAS spectra (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) for measurements of the above compounds in the atmosphere and in reaction chambers, while the IR absorption cross sections will primarily be useful in laboratory studies on atmospheric chemistry, where FT-IR spectrometry is an important tool.},

Long range absolute oscillator strength (cross section) measurements have been performed at ≈1 eV fwhm resolution, while the low energy discrete structured region (3–20 eV) has been examined in more detail at ≈50 meV fwhm resolution. Absolute oscillator strenghts for many of the individual discrete vibronic transitions have been obtained. In addition, dipole (e,e + ion) coincidence spectroscopy has been used to study the ionic photofragmentation of formaldehyde. Photoion branching ratios, absolute partial photoionization oscillator strenghts and photoionization efficiencies have been obtained from the first IP up to 80 eV photon energy. A dipole induced breakdown scheme for formaldehyde has been derived using the present results in combination with previously published photoelectron-photoion coincidence measurements (R. Bombach et al., Int. J. Mass Spectrum. Ion Phys. 40 (1981) 275) and experimental (D.M.P. Holland, Chem. Phys. 133 (1989) 453) and theoretical (P.W. Langhoff et al., J. Chem.

From this breakdown analysis, electronic ion state partial photoionization oscillator strengths for formaldehyde from 14–30 eV photon energy have been derived.},

The He(I) photoelectron spectrum was also collected to quantify ionisation energies in the 9–16.1 eV spectral region. These experiments are supported by the first high-level ab initio calculations performed on the excited states of the neutral molecule and on the ground state of the positive ion. The excellent agreement between the theoretical results and the measurements allows us to solve several discrepancies concerning the electronic state spectroscopy of THF.

The photoabsorption measurements cover the energy range 5–300 eV while the formation of electronic states of O2+ (photoelectron spectroscopy) and the resulting ionic fragmentation (photoionization mass spectrometry) are both measured from close to threshold up to photon energies of 75 eV. The binding energy spectra of O2 show peaks at 33, 47 and 57 eV in addition to those reported elsewhere in the literature. These peaks are assigned to multiple final ion states arising from photoionization of the inner valence orbitals. Structure in the O2+ electronic state partial oscillator strength curves is in good agreement with recent theoretical work which predicts the existence of several shape resonances. A quantitative picture of the dipole-induced breakdown of O2 is obtained for the energy range 12–75 eV. The photoionization efficiency is found to be constant above 20 eV.},
